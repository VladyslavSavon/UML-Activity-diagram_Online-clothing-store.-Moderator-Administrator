Online closing store website: UML activity diagram for the Moderator and Administrator Roles

##

The UML activity diagram for the Moderator and Administrator roles represents their journey within the system, from accessing the website to completing their interactions. It illustrates how the moderator and administrator interact with each other and the system. Notably, this diagram focuses exclusively on moderator-administrator activities, while customer interactions are covered in a separate activity diagram. It is important to note that this diagram represents the MVP version and is intended to be expanded in future iterations.
